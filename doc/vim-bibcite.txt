=============================================================================
INTRODUCTION                                            *vim-bibcite-intro*

This plugin provides completion of citations in TeX and LaTeX documents. The
completions are drawn from `.bib` files in the same directory as the document.

=============================================================================
USAGE                                                   *vim-bibcite-usage*

vim-bibcite provides completions drawn from any `.bib` files found in the same
directory as the file the user is editing. Simply start typing a citation and
enter CTRL-X CTRL-O to trigger a list of possible completions. (See :help
|i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O| for more details about how to browse the list of possible
completions.)

That's it. No configuration is needed or possible. (See below for
limitations.)

=============================================================================
REQUIREMENTS                                     *vim-bibcite-requirements*

vim-bibcite requires bibtex. If bibtex isn't found, vim-bibcite does nothing.

=============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                   *vim-bibcite-configuration*

vim-bibcite is zero configuration. This may change if I add options to search
more widely for `.bib` files.

=============================================================================
LIMITATIONS                                       *vim-bibcite-limitations*

The user can't manually tell vim-bibcite where to find `.bib` files. If `.bib`
files are not in the exact same directory as the file the user is editing,
vim-bibcite won't find them.

If people want these features, I am willing to consider adding them. Please
let me know.

THANKS                                                 *vim-bibcite-thanks*

I initially based this plugin on vim-autocite, written by Guillem Ballesteros.
He based that, in turn, on vimtex, written by Karl Yngve Lerv√•g. Later,
I reviewed both vim-autocite and vimtex, and I drew code and ideas from both.
I thank both authors for their work, which made coming up with vim-bibcite
a snap.
